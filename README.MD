# Nodejs Shopee Open Api Client

this project started as my goal to use shopee api easily. this project has not fully tested yet. but basic functions still function perfectly.


## Usage
```
npm install shopee-client
```

## Basic Usage
```
let client = new ShopeeClient({
  is_uat: false,
  shop_id: 'YOUR_SHOP_ID',
  partner_id: 'YOUR_PARTNER_ID',
  partner_key: 'YOUR_PARTNER_KEY'
})
let response = await client.image.uploadImage({
  images: [
    'https://i.picsum.photos/id/790/200/300.jpg'
  ]
});
console.log(response);
```

There is 13 modules :
- Category (category)
